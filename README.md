# Hi, I'm Misti 👋

## About Me
I am taking CTI-110 (Web, Program, and Database Foundation) to learn various aspects of information technology.
I am also taking a Linux class.

## My Foo 🎯
🎧 🎶 Music has always been a _**big**_ part of my life. When I was two years old, the only way my Mom could get me to go to sleep was to play Bob Seger's _Old Time Rock and Roll_ over and over again. She had to record it on a cassette tape (on both sides) and let it continously play. Fast forward (ahem) quite a few years later, and music is still something that I am **_extremely_** passionate about. I truly like music across pretty much all genres (although I do not like EVERY song in every genre). Some of my favorites though (in no particular order) are: Fleetwood Mac, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ren, Taylor Swift, Reba McIntire, Garth Brooks, Eminem, Linkin Park, Nightwish, and pretty much most musicals. 🎶 🎧

## Fun Facts
🏥 I was so accident prone growing up that I was on a first named basis with the people in the emergency room. They literally kept my file up at the triage desk.

🎶 In high school, my vocal range spanned so far that I was able to fill in for any needed position with the expection of the bass section. The choir director _loved_ having me in the choir. 🎶
