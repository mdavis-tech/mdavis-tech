# Hi 👋, I'm Misti Davis

### I'm a new enthusiast to the tech world. I am interested in exploring the various aspects of what technology has to offer and how it is growing.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning **AI Fundamentals (CSC-113) which I am excited about, this is something completely new to me. **

- 🎧 Listening to music is my passion. I can do without most things, but listening to music is not one of them. I have been a music lover since I was two. Music is on in my house at least 75% of the time.

- ⚡ Fun fact: **In high school, my singing voice range went from tenor to soprano (1st tenor, 2nd alto, 1st alto, 2nd soprano, 1st soprano), which was helpful filling in at choir performances.**
